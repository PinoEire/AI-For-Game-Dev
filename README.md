End-to-End Game Development with Contemporary AI Systems

Project overview

This project investigates whether, and in what sense, contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) systems can support the development of a complete videogame from initial concept to a finished, playable product in 2025/2026. The focus is not only on technical feasibility, but also on the role AI systems play within the game development pipeline, and on how different model families map onto different types of game-development tasks.

For the purpose of this study, “AI systems” include large language models (LLMs), code-generation tools, image and video diffusion models, audio and music generation models, and other generative or assistive tools commonly available in 2025/2026. “All aspects of a game” refers to the major stages and artefacts involved in game production: game design and documentation, narrative and dialogue, source code and technical implementation, art and animation, audio and music, quality assurance and balancing, and, where relevant, supporting materials such as store pages or marketing copy.

The project aims to provide an empirically grounded characterisation of AI’s current capabilities and limitations in end-to-end game development, and to map typical workflows in which human developers and AI systems collaborate.
